Walmart, Target, Lowe’s, Home Depot, Kohls…they have had virtually no net store growth in recent years and the likes of Kohls and Target are looking to shrink their store size.  Others are shuttering stores.

I’m in on COST, they have maybe 1/3 of the stores of other retailers.  It’s no NVDA, but the basic principals are there.  Immense consumer satisfaction, good management, growth potential, and lastly, their financials.  That’s my own research that I’m not prepared to share.

mj3h9j9,Unknown Post,"I'll try to simplify it loosely. 

Banks provide mortgage loans secured by real estate.  Banks make money off origination and servicing fees. Asset prices increase. Banks want to lend more but need more liquidity so they take the loans they own and sell them to another party (typically a GSE). The GSE packages mortgages into securitizations and sells them back to investors while guaranteeing the underlying mortgages will make their payments. GSEs make money from guarantee fees. 


But there are types of mortgages/properties GSEs don't like, these are called ""non-conforming"". This creates opportunities for smaller investment banks and other private firms who have capital but more risk appetite to purchase loans and make their own securitizations. They do that and call them CDOs, a CDO is a type of securitization. These non-GSE ""private label"" CDOs do not have guarantees like the ones GSEs give for the securitizations they sell. In order to hedge their risk, investors in these non-guaranteed CDOs enter into swap contracts called ""credit default swaps"", sometimes with the same investment bank that sold them the CDO.


Then as CDSs became more prevalent, the CDSs themselves could be bought and sold entirely separate from the CDO/pool of assets they were contractually guaranteeing. Those CDSs that were being sold were then pooled into their own CDOs similar to the way the mortgages themselves were packaged into a CDO. That new type of CDO that is full of those separate CDSs is then called a Synthetic CDO, because the CDS CDO doesn't actually contain debts or mortgages, it contains swap contracts made on unrelated CDOs that do contain actual mortgages.",1742616624.0

But also, when is the last time you encountered an obstacle driving, that was trying to look like the road but was a wall? Yeah probably a situation thats happened yes, exactly once now.

There is no such thing as a system that doesn't have a failure point.

I also really enjoy people that don't own a Tesla with FSD telling me about how FSD performs.

I do have a Tesla Plaid with FSD, its quite nice, its fun when I want fun, and also, a chauffeur, when I wan a chauffeur.

Its obviously not like a fun car in the same way that like an e36 m3 is fun, thats my weekend joy, but that instant always everywhere acceleration is fun, but then also, it can just drive me places.

I think you made a good close",1742589167.0
mj1dgb3,WTF happened?!,"Auto liquidation by broker since it was deep in the money. Looks like Etrade, next time call them and tell them to not auto liquidate and they won’t do this. But you have to call in each time you have options ITM or close to ITM on expiry day. 

Most brokers have an auto liquidation process if you don’t have the necessary $$$ to sustain an options exercise.",1742589502.0
mj1ps0h,WTF happened?!,"Yup, if you're sitting on profitable options that are about to expire worthless  within the next approximately 90mins or less, and your account doesn't have the resources needed to exercise,the brokerage doesn't usually just let it go up in smoke. They'll close for you. This is especially true if the position is using some of their margin.

This is `**NOT**` guaranteed behavior though so people should not just assume this will always happen on all brokerages. Probably depends on the net worth of the entire account.

e.g., I buy some 0DTE on Gamestop and go to work, it's announced that GME is now America's official online-download-for-games for ALL consoles in USA. GME goes to the moon and the options are worth 800% of my entire portfolio, E-Trade would probably phone call me. If I don't pick up, they'll definitely sell-to-close for me. But that's 'cuz Etrade and that's because they can see the position is worth multiples of my entire port so they can assume I'd be pretty upset to find out later the options expired - even though it's my own fault.

Etrade stands to gain as well 'cuz when you're pleasantly surprised by a very profitable transaction made on your behalf, you're more likely to leave those funds in your Etrade account - and they definitely like having more customers with large balances :)",1742593320.0

Walmart, Target, Lowe’s, Home Depot, Kohls…they have had virtually no net store growth in recent years and the likes of Kohls and Target are looking to shrink their store size.  Others are shuttering stores.

I’m in on COST, they have maybe 1/3 of the stores of other retailers.  It’s no NVDA, but the basic principals are there.  Immense consumer satisfaction, good management, growth potential, and lastly, their financials.  That’s my own research that I’m not prepared to share.

mj3h9j9,Unknown Post,"I'll try to simplify it loosely. 

Banks provide mortgage loans secured by real estate.  Banks make money off origination and servicing fees. Asset prices increase. Banks want to lend more but need more liquidity so they take the loans they own and sell them to another party (typically a GSE). The GSE packages mortgages into securitizations and sells them back to investors while guaranteeing the underlying mortgages will make their payments. GSEs make money from guarantee fees. 


But there are types of mortgages/properties GSEs don't like, these are called ""non-conforming"". This creates opportunities for smaller investment banks and other private firms who have capital but more risk appetite to purchase loans and make their own securitizations. They do that and call them CDOs, a CDO is a type of securitization. These non-GSE ""private label"" CDOs do not have guarantees like the ones GSEs give for the securitizations they sell. In order to hedge their risk, investors in these non-guaranteed CDOs enter into swap contracts called ""credit default swaps"", sometimes with the same investment bank that sold them the CDO.


Then as CDSs became more prevalent, the CDSs themselves could be bought and sold entirely separate from the CDO/pool of assets they were contractually guaranteeing. Those CDSs that were being sold were then pooled into their own CDOs similar to the way the mortgages themselves were packaged into a CDO. That new type of CDO that is full of those separate CDSs is then called a Synthetic CDO, because the CDS CDO doesn't actually contain debts or mortgages, it contains swap contracts made on unrelated CDOs that do contain actual mortgages.",1742616624.0

mj30f5d,Unknown Post,"Waymo is level 4 because it relies on lidar scans of the places it is cleared to operate. Level 5 requires ability to respond to all situations. If there is new constructions or road changes that haven't been scanned, it can't respond well, thats why its level 4. As Bill Hicks would say, you definitely aren't one of those readers.

mj3ko4r,Unknown Post,"""Because it relies on Lidar""....lol...who gives a fuck what it relies on?  It works and it's level 4...Waymo has been operating and offering DRIVERLESS robotaxis since 2020...this is FIVE years more than Tesla...because Tesla hasn't done shit...all Elon has done is run his mouth and make shit up

Tesla's FSD hasn't even proven that it can attain level 4 yet...it's generally considered to be level 2...if you're being generous, then it's a level 3...but no way is it a 4

And all of a sudden it's going to magically get certified as level 5 in California?

mj3cvib,Unknown Post,"I didn't have FSD, and it autopilot wasn't even enabled when he crashed through the wall. Entertainment is entertainment, shocking. It's almost like they... gasp... precut out the foam in a specific pattern.... and were you know planning on achieving a narrative goal... Go look it up, report back. But also, when is the last time you encountered an obstacle driving, that was trying to look like the road but was a wall? Yeah probably a situation thats happened yes, exactly once now.

There is no such thing as a system that doesn't have a failure point.

I also really enjoy people that don't own a Tesla with FSD telling me about how FSD performs.

I do have a Tesla Plaid with FSD, its quite nice, its fun when I want fun, and also, a chauffeur, when I wan a chauffeur.

Its obviously not like a fun car in the same way that like an e36 m3 is fun, thats my weekend joy, but that instant always everywhere acceleration is fun, but then also, it can just drive me places. End to end, just put in where I want to go, it takes me there, I have to do nothing most the time. A few years ago, it was much worse, its dramatically improved recently.",1742614683.0

mj1dgb3,WTF happened?!,"Auto liquidation by broker since it was deep in the money. Looks like Etrade, next time call them and tell them to not auto liquidate and they won’t do this. But you have to call in each time you have options ITM or close to ITM on expiry day. 

Most brokers have an auto liquidation process if you don’t have the necessary $$$ to sustain an options exercise.",1742589502.0
mj1ps0h,WTF happened?!,"Yup, if you're sitting on profitable options that are about to expire worthless  within the next approximately 90mins or less, and your account doesn't have the resources needed to exercise,the brokerage doesn't usually just let it go up in smoke. They'll close for you. This is especially true if the position is using some of their margin.

This is `**NOT**` guaranteed behavior though so people should not just assume this will always happen on all brokerages. Probably depends on the net worth of the entire account.

e.g., I buy some 0DTE on Gamestop and go to work, it's announced that GME is now America's official online-download-for-games for ALL consoles in USA. GME goes to the moon and the options are worth 800% of my entire portfolio, E-Trade would probably phone call me. If I don't pick up, they'll definitely sell-to-close for me. But that's 'cuz Etrade and that's because they can see the position is worth multiples of my entire port so they can assume I'd be pretty upset to find out later the options expired - even though it's my own fault.

Etrade stands to gain as well 'cuz when you're pleasantly surprised by a very profitable transaction made on your behalf, you're more likely to leave those funds in your Etrade account - and they definitely like having more customers with large balances :)",1742593320.0

Had another guy who was a bored retiree who got into day trading. He hands me his brokerage statement and my jaw dropped. He had $35 million in stock proceeds.

It’s the only big player in big box retail that isn’t  over saturated in terms of store counts.  They clip along at about 3%/yr in store growth.  I’ve done the DD on numerous retailers and Cost has the most upside to increase revenue via growth vs cost management, aka quality.

Walmart, Target, Lowe’s, Home Depot, Kohls…they have had virtually no net store growth in recent years and the likes of Kohls and Target are looking to shrink their store size.  Others are shuttering stores.

I’m in on COST, they have maybe 1/3 of the stores of other retailers.  It’s no NVDA, but the basic principals are there.  Immense consumer satisfaction, good management, growth potential, and lastly, their financials.  That’s my own research that I’m not prepared to share.

mj3h9j9,Unknown Post,"I'll try to simplify it loosely. 

Banks provide mortgage loans secured by real estate.  Banks make money off origination and servicing fees. Asset prices increase. Banks want to lend more but need more liquidity so they take the loans they own and sell them to another party (typically a GSE). The GSE packages mortgages into securitizations and sells them back to investors while guaranteeing the underlying mortgages will make their payments. GSEs make money from guarantee fees. 


But there are types of mortgages/properties GSEs don't like, these are called ""non-conforming"". This creates opportunities for smaller investment banks and other private firms who have capital but more risk appetite to purchase loans and make their own securitizations. They do that and call them CDOs, a CDO is a type of securitization. These non-GSE ""private label"" CDOs do not have guarantees like the ones GSEs give for the securitizations they sell. In order to hedge their risk, investors in these non-guaranteed CDOs enter into swap contracts called ""credit default swaps"", sometimes with the same investment bank that sold them the CDO.


Then as CDSs became more prevalent, the CDSs themselves could be bought and sold entirely separate from the CDO/pool of assets they were contractually guaranteeing. Those CDSs that were being sold were then pooled into their own CDOs similar to the way the mortgages themselves were packaged into a CDO. That new type of CDO that is full of those separate CDSs is then called a Synthetic CDO, because the CDS CDO doesn't actually contain debts or mortgages, it contains swap contracts made on unrelated CDOs that do contain actual mortgages.",1742616624.0

A burrito is a rolled up sandwich. A pizza is an open face sandwich. A hotdog is just sandwich with a long piece of bread instead of two pieces. I hope this new context helps you understand OP better.",1742610025.0
mj3pj8w,Unknown Post,"Nah, BNPL can get securitized. Most of them get paid off within a short period of time interest free, as you mentioned. The BNPL securitization debt (ABS) is basically just sold at a discount to par.

For example, consumer buys a $20 Chipotle bowl using Klarna - Klarna will pay, say, $18 to Chipotle (the merchant discount). Klarna can then package together a bunch of these receivables and borrow at a reasonable LTV against them, but as you mentioned, the debt issued against these securitization SPVs is less so traditional term ABS structures and more so short term discount bonds, almost.

Due to the very short term nature of these BNPL loans, the SPV is also usually structured as a form of a Master Trust wherein you can keep contributing receivables into the securitization over time, almost letting it act like a non-recourse ABL revolver for the BNPL originator.",1742620834.0

Not as much systemic risk.

But also, when is the last time you encountered an obstacle driving, that was trying to look like the road but was a wall? Yeah probably a situation thats happened yes, exactly once now.

There is no such thing as a system that doesn't have a failure point.

I also really enjoy people that don't own a Tesla with FSD telling me about how FSD performs.

I do have a Tesla Plaid with FSD, its quite nice, its fun when I want fun, and also, a chauffeur, when I wan a chauffeur.

Its obviously not like a fun car in the same way that like an e36 m3 is fun, thats my weekend joy, but that instant always everywhere acceleration is fun, but then also, it can just drive me places.

mj1cc72,WTF happened?!,"Dont be mad at this one, I think it is unlikely that you are able to hold this option, broker will close it at a certain point (depends on broker), if you don't have the cash to exercise you won't be able to hold through the run

  
I think you made a good close",1742589167.0
mj1dgb3,WTF happened?!,"Auto liquidation by broker since it was deep in the money. Looks like Etrade, next time call them and tell them to not auto liquidate and they won’t do this. But you have to call in each time you have options ITM or close to ITM on expiry day. 

Most brokers have an auto liquidation process if you don’t have the necessary $$$ to sustain an options exercise.",1742589502.0
mj1ps0h,WTF happened?!,"Yup, if you're sitting on profitable options that are about to expire worthless  within the next approximately 90mins or less, and your account doesn't have the resources needed to exercise,the brokerage doesn't usually just let it go up in smoke. They'll close for you. This is especially true if the position is using some of their margin.

This is `**NOT**` guaranteed behavior though so people should not just assume this will always happen on all brokerages. Probably depends on the net worth of the entire account.

e.g., I buy some 0DTE on Gamestop and go to work, it's announced that GME is now America's official online-download-for-games for ALL consoles in USA. GME goes to the moon and the options are worth 800% of my entire portfolio, E-Trade would probably phone call me. If I don't pick up, they'll definitely sell-to-close for me. But that's 'cuz Etrade and that's because they can see the position is worth multiples of my entire port so they can assume I'd be pretty upset to find out later the options expired - even though it's my own fault.

Etrade stands to gain as well 'cuz when you're pleasantly surprised by a very profitable transaction made on your behalf, you're more likely to leave those funds in your Etrade account - and they definitely like having more customers with large balances :)",1742593320.0

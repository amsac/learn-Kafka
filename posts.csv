1jgr95w,0DTE SPY roller coaster - $103k gain porn ðŸŽ¢ðŸ’°ðŸš€,"Hello fellow regards, I just experienced peak WSB degeneracy.

Started with SPY 564 calls 0DTE. Market went more sideways than my trading strategy. Cut losses at -20%.

In true smooth-brain fashion, took my remaining cash and YOLOed 1000 contracts of SPY 563 calls at 3:40pm. $16k on paper tickets with 20 minutes to expiry.

Hit $190k at peak then Questrade decided to ""risk review"" me for 30 seconds. Cost me about $85k when I couldn't sell at the top. Still escaped with $103k profit.

Thought I was gonna start working at Wendy's, but the last 10 minutes changed everything.
Seriously though, that last 15 mins of trading was pure insanity - never doing that again. Like a Boomer, I'm going to invest these gains in IXUS and XEQT instead of trying my luck next week.

Shoutout to PumpkinWest7430, gave some guidance and tried to keep me sane but my degeneracy couldn't help it.
